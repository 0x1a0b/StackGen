It’s outdated and loaded with baggage. It smells like a members-only club. Everyone should be encouraged to start his own business, and not some rate breed that self-identifies as entrepreneurs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There’s a new group of people out there starting business. They’re turning profits yet never think of themselves as entrepreneurs. A lot of them done even think of themselves as business owners. They are just doing what they love on their own terms and getting paid for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So let’s replace the fancy-sounding worth with something a bit more down-to-earth. Instead of entrepreneurs, let’s call them starters. Anyone who creates new business is a starter. You don’t need an MBA, a certificate, a fancy suit, a briefcase, or an above-average, tolerance for risk. You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get you started.”</p>\n</blockquote>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"Starter: First you must answer \"Why?\" Every system and process has its \"bottleneck\" -- the one point in the workflow that takes the most…","frontmatter":{"title":"ReWork and Starter","cover":"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/images/wallpaper/PIA11777-640x350.jpg","date":"2018-12-14","category":"tech","tags":["programming","security","encryption","database"],"author":null},"fields":{"slug":"/rework-and-starter"}},"prev":{"excerpt":"Built-in Auto Generated Fields Starter Ignite adds a set of built-in fields to every generated object and…","frontmatter":{"title":"Auto-Generated Ignite Fields","cover":"images/mission_street.jpeg","date":"2018-12-17"},"fields":{"slug":"/ignite-auto-generated-fields"}},"next":{"excerpt":"What is SecureField ™  Technology?
