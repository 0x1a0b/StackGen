### Starter: First you must answer "Why?"

Every system and process has its "bottleneck" -- the one point in the workflow that takes the most time, that is the most inefficient, and that would show the most benefit if it were improved.

Often when we optimize a software program, we focus on the bottleneck and implement code that eliminates or otherwise alleviates the inefficiency and thus we "move the bottleneck". As each bottleneck is fixed, the bottleneck of the program "moves" to the next poorly performing section of code.

I named Starter after the new style of entrepreneur defined in the great business classic "Rework".

### Rework shows you a better, faster, easier way to succeed in business.

**Rework by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson**
> “Let’s retire the term entrepreneur. It’s outdated and loaded with baggage. It smells like a members-only club. Everyone should be encouraged to start his own business, and not some rate breed that self-identifies as entrepreneurs.

> There’s a new group of people out there starting business. They’re turning profits yet never think of themselves as entrepreneurs. A lot of them done even think of themselves as business owners. They are just doing what they love on their own terms and getting paid for it.

> So let’s replace the fancy-sounding worth with something a bit more down-to-earth. Instead of entrepreneurs, let’s call them starters. Anyone who creates new business is a starter. You don’t need an MBA, a certificate, a fancy suit, a briefcase, or an above-average, tolerance for risk. You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get you started.”
