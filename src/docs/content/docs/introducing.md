**StackGen&trade;** is an application generation and automation platform that uses robust, scalable data-based service engines with built-in encryption to deliver amazing software in less time for less money.

> the StackGen Professional

StackGen is for autonomous coders, startup founders, and “Citizen Developers” that suffer from software development costs and delays, or who sadly end up doing without the apps and features they need.

> the StackGen Difference

Unlike alternative options, the StackGen solution provides great open source product support and complete deployment flexibility: build once, run anywhere.

StackGen leverages the best technology platforms available with a Spring-Boot backend driving front ends using:

- ReactJS
- React Native
- React360

> Total Deployment Flexibility

Generated apps are built ready to deploy on all major cloud platforms, production servers, development and testing environments without modification.

> Build Early, Build Often

**StackGen Pro** offers AWS-specific generated AMI to allow for development of managed apps for your end users under your AWS account.

**StackGen Pro** also promotes effortless Database migrations and advanced data development features that allow for smooth maintenance and agile development of new features without degrading existing data integrity.

**StackGen Pro** offers Liquibase changelogs and ability to roll changes forward and back on live servers.

**Coming Soon** LearningMode&trade; Database development creates database schemas on the fly from incoming JSON payloads (POST and PUT calls.)

Columns and the associated code are generated and the entire service module is rebuilt on the fly, allowing for incredibly fast database development.
