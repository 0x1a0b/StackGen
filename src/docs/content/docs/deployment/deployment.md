### StackGen is architected with flexibility for existing and future integration.

By not locking you into any particular architecture, framework, or even language, StackGen aims to provide a convenient and powerful low code and automation solution that fits your needs even as your needs evolve over time.

> **PRODUCT ROADMAP**: initially (2019) StackGen development is focused on generating a great, multipurpose Java Spring Boot REST service.  StackGen PRO further generates a React/React Native app.  While this certainly covers a lot of use cases, we hope to expand the default app generation templates with user-defined and marketplace app and functionality templates.
