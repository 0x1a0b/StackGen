### Built-in Auto Generated Fields

> StackGen adds a set of built-in fields to every generated object and database.

This is a configurable setting however much of the functionality improvements require the existence of these fieldâ€™s.

In the future we will add the ability to toggle these Fields on a per object basis for situations where additional overhead is not desired.

Currently the auto generated ignite fields are as follows:

Modified_date
Created_date
Owner_ID
ID
Key version

These fields are not available in the rest API by default however they will be returned in JSON payload.
