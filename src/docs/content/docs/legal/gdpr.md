GDPR
On May 25, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective bringing new global data protection rights for individuals in the European Union. Starter fully supports the privacy rights of our customers and their users and has achieved GDPR compliance.

Starter Inc. offers a data processing agreement (DPA) for customers processing information on behalf of EU and Swiss citizens. Please contact privacy@starter.io for more information.

As we all work to understand and apply GDPR concepts to our own businesses, we’ve created the below outline to keep you informed of our efforts. We’ll be proactively reaching out to our entire customer base once we have best practices to share.

What steps are we taking to comply with GDPR?
Privacy Shield

Starter is fully compliant with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. You can verify our participation here.

Updated DPA

Our DPA has been revised to reflect both regulatory and operational changes related to GDPR. You can view and sign a copy here.

Initial Product strategy

Using our research and model, we’ve defined the product roadmap necessary to allow Starter as Controller and Starter as Processor to become compliant with GDPR

Vendor audit

We are reviewing all vendors who act as sub-processors for Starter data, auditing their approach to GDPR, and entering into DPAs where necessary.

Continuing Efforts
Research
Consult with internal and external counsel to understand legal interpretations of the GDPR requirements
Work with other leading technology firms to understand the market’s general interpretation and best practices
Perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment as a security review to determine compliance with GDPR security requirements and industry best standards
Modeling
Based on our research, we’re developing our working interpretative model as a reference and guide for internal processes

Product & Process implementation
We are actively implementing pieces of the compliance roadmap within our product offering

Communication & messaging
Finalize and communicate GDPR specifics to customers

Ongoing Product strategy
While we have an initial set of product changes related to GDPR, we will continually be evaluating and adding new security and privacy functionality in Starter.

Product Features/Changes
Ability to delete an individual within the UI and receive an audit log (currently, you can contact us to delete specific users)

Ability to discard IP addresses and exclude them from the UI

More fine-grained exclusion / recording mechanisms tied to consent

Product strategy will continue to evolve around GDPR. Future product changes that you may see include:

User identification processes and mechanisms
Retroactive deletion of specific field captures
Active monitoring & alerting around recorded data that appears sensitive

How are we thinking about compliance for our customers and what do you need to do?

It is important to note that Starter is acting both as a Data Controller and as a Data Processor within the realm of GDPR compliance.

We are a controller with respect to our visitors and customers interacting with any domain within our control (e.g. www.starter.io, app.starter.io, docs.starter.io, blog.starter.io, etc.).

We are a processor (and occasionally a subprocessor) with respect to the end users whose data Starter receives: our customers’ users.

As a customer of Starter, you are a data controller and Starter is acting as your data processor for your users. In this respect, you’ll want to take the following steps as we approach May 25th:

Ensure your Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy are up to date

If you have customers in the EU, please sign our updated DPA here.

Perform your own research, modeling, vendor audit, and strategy steps at your company to ensure you understand GDPR as it applies to your business.

Watch for updates from Starter related to product functionality or T&C changes.
