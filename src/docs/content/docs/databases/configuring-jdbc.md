#### Connecting to JDBC Data Sourcess

As they are out-of-the-box Spring-Boot applications, Starter StackGen services are easily able to store and retrieve data using external data stores.

Currently we provide support for OLTP Relational RDBs and as such in the short term we are supporting API CRUD operations against the following RDBMS:

- MySQL
- Postgres
- Oracle

The StackGen project uses JDBC drivers to connect to the database of your choice as specified in the command line or configuration parameters:

```
java -jar <your-api-name>-1.0.1-exec.jar  
...
-DdbUrl=<DB host address>
-DdbName=<DB Schema Name>
-DdbUser=<DB Username>
-DdbPassword=<DB Password>
...
```
