## Github

Clone the project by running one of these commands:

```bash http
git clone https://github.com/StarterInc/StackGen.git
```
After the clone succeeds, navigate to `StackGen/` on your machine and run `mvn clean install`.

You should see output similar to the following:
```
TODO: output from mvn clean install
```

## StackGen CLI

If you simply have the StackGen jar then use the StackGen CLI by running:

```sh
java -jar StackGen.jar -all -the -things
```
